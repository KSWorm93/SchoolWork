I have made 2 tests using a old project from datamatiker 3 semester.
I have tested the findUser and findProject, which both look at the database 
through a facade.

In my tests i mock the connection to the database using mockito, specifying
what i want it to return to me.

Another way this could have been done, is to set up a new database which is used
for testing only.
and at the start of each test, you delete all data and insert some.
this will ensure that you always have the same data at the start of each test.
and you will only need to change which database you use, and wont necesarily 
have to mock anything away.
