This is my review based on Anders Bjergfelt
https://github.com/andersbjergfelt/Triangle_Exercise_Test


I have found a few flaws that could have been worked more on.
You have not handled if the input is something else than a integer
fx if i input "a" or "2,1" it will throw an exception and the program will crash.

You have handled it in a way that when you catch the exception you will get to the 
end of the program and be asked "to press any key to continue..." and then i press
a key, and the program shuts down.
Its good and bad, i expected it to start over or let me input a new input since it
told me to "continue", and not to shutdown :)

Other than that i would have liked more documentation in the code, in the form of
comments for the individual methods to make it clearer what they are doing.
With that said, i like your naming of methods/variables, they make sense. 
which helps understand the code better.

And as long as you input correct integers the program function, and you check if
it is a valid triangle, which is nice :)
