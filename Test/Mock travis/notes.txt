Thing to take note of i found during this exercise:

Maven from commandline/terminal use different(by default, on my machine at least)
versions of the plugins, than the netbeans maven.

so when trying to execute some of the commands

mvn compile
mvn verify
mvn test
mvn verify site

some of them will fail, because there was a bug in the version i used on my machine
i had to add the specific plugin to the pom file to avoid getting that bug.

to sum it up: add plugin to pom with specific version number if working on multiple
machines, or in teams. to avoid bugs from different versions of maven on
the local machines running them.
