When implementing the interface. there was a problem with the getFormattedDate()
method, because it was static.
Which gives th issue that all other methods that uses it need to be static.

isStringValid
when no public/private/protected is written before a method name
it will be package protected. and can not be seen in the test classes.
making it 

coverage
we get little coverage on our different joketypes.
reason being we mock them, so we dont actually use them.

JUnit
JUnit is a unit framework to unit test in Java.

Mockito
Mockito is a mocking framework, which makes it super easy to mock away dependencies

Hamcrest
Hamcrest is a different matcher tool used in tests.
making the tests more "readable", so the tests can be "normal" english.

Jacoco
Jacoco gives you a overview over the lines of code that are executed durings your
tests. And as an added bonus highlight them so you easily can see it.
As a general note you should strive for 80% coverage.
I only hit ~50% so i am a bit behind..

Most of these tools and tools like them will have a maven plugin / dependency
making it extremely easy to setup across multiple pc'es, using Maven.

can be done by doing something like this:
<dependency>
   <groupId>junit</groupId>
   <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
   <version>4.12</version>
   <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
